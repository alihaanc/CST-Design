# CST-Design
Antenna design and electromagetic analysis


Hello everyone this is my first antenna design in CST. This first step for my big project. The antenna that I design is a 2.4 GHz microstrip antenna. 
As you know Antennas are data transmission devices that can collect or radiate electromagnetic waves and are designed according to characteristics such as frequency, wavelength and wave propagation.
The idea of ​​microstrip patch antennas arose from utilizing printed circuit technology not only for the circuit components and transmission lines but also for the radiating elements of an electronic system.
It was first proposed by Deschamps [1]. However, little attention was paid to his idea until the 1970s. 
Since then, this class of antennas has been the subject of intensive research and development.
